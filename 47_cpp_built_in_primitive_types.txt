--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++ Primitive Data Types

	- Fundamental data types implemented directly by the C++
	  language

	- Character types

	- Integer types

		+ signed and unsigned

	- Floating-point types

	- Boolean types

	- Size and precision is often compiler-dependent

		+ #include <climits>


Type Sizes

	- Expressed in bits

	- The more bits the more values that can be represented

	- The more bits the more storage required



Size (in bits)		Representable Values

8			256				2^(8)
16			65,536				2^(16)
32			4,294,967,296			2^(32)
64			18,446,744,073,709,551,615	2^(64)


Character Types

	- Used to represent single characters, 'A', 'X', '@'

	- Wider types are used to represent wide character
	  sets

Type Name		Size / Precision

char			Exactly on byte, at least 8 bits
char16_t		At least 16 bits
char32_t		At least 32 bits
wchar_t			Can represent the largest available 
			character set


Integer Types

	- Used to represent whole numbers

	- Signed and unsigned versions

Type Name		Size / Precision

signed short int	At least 16 bits
signed int		At least 16 bits
signed long int		At least 32 bits
signed long long int	At least 64 bits

Type Name		Size / Precision

unsigned short int	At least 16 bits
unsigned int		At least 16 bits
unsigned long int	At least 32 bits
unsigned long long int	At least 64 bits


Floating-point Types

	- Used to represent non-integer numbers

	- Represented by mantissa and exponent (scientific notation)

	- Precision is the number of digits in the mantissa

	- Precision and size are compiler dependent

Type Name 	Size / Typical Precision			Typical Range

float		/ 7 decimal digits				1.2 x 10^(-38) to 3.4 x 10^(38)
double		No less than float / 15 decimal digits		2.2 x 10^(-308) to 1.8 x 10^(308)
long double	No less than double / 19 decimal digits		3.3 x 10^(-4932) to 1.2 x 10^(4932)


Boolean Type

	- Used to represent true and false

	- Zero is false

	- Non-zero is true

Type Name 	Size / Precision

bool		Usually 8 bits
		true or false (C++ keywords)
